# Hello! 👋

I learn Swift almost every day, and I'd like to share my progress with you. Feel free to hack the playgrounds as you like! 🙌

## What I learned so far...

- Basic data types
- Strings, substrings
- Tuples
- Collections - Array, Dictionary
- Structures and Enumerations
- Properties and observers `willSet` and `didSet`
- Mutability vs Immutability
- Loops
- Switch cases and the `fallthrough` keyword
- Optionals and unwrapping
- Classes, `init` and `deinit`, retain cycles
- Subscripts
- Protocols and conformance
- Generics ✨
- Custom Operators 😍
- Property wrappers
- Result builders

If you feel I have missed something, just let me know! ✨
